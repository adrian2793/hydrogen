> Installing Extensions

Simple click **Install** or **Add** after you have found an Extension you like and want to use for your channel.

**Adding** an Extension will add it to your **My Extensions** list. You may need to configure and Activate the Extension. **Installing** an Extension adds it to your **My Extensions** list and you may be presented with a modal pop-up informing you that your Extension installation was successful with an option to either configure the Extension or continue browsing.

#### How to Configure Extensions

After you have added an Extension to your channel, some may require configuration before you can Activate them. Every developer includes instructions on how to configure their Extension. Some Extensions may pop up and prompt you to configure after adding. Others require you to visit your **My Extensions** page.
